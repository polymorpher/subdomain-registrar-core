# ENS Subdomain registrar core

This contains only the contract code from [`@ensdomains/subdomain-registrar`](https://github.com/ensdomains/subdomain-registrar), so other projects can easily import the contract by adding this project as a dependency, and avoid various compilation / dependency issues.
